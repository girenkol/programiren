Dear Sir or Madam,
I am writing with regard to last exhibition 'Art in our Town' happened last weekend. I would like demonstrate my opinion on it. It is required to mansion that not all of 250 works of art, including paintings, photographs, sculptures and pots was excellent. My research shows that sculptures were the best part of the exhibition. I would like to express that information included in leaflet should be reflected when visitors come.
It is also a good idea to encourage people by selling pieces. I had a discussion with some people who came just for trading.
The exhibition was opened at the Town Hall where was not enough space for everyone. I recommend organizing next events in larger place. In my opinion the price for tickets was too high. If entering was free, more people would visit and more pieces would be bought.
I am looking forward to the next event.
